## Safe Sharing: Access Control for Cloud Stored Data
<h3> Abstract </h3>
<p>The rapid expansion of cloud environments has brought about a significant challenge to secure data storage. This is a critical consideration for every user when decided to move the data online. To address this challenge, various solutions have been proposed, with two prominent approaches being Searchable Symmetric Encryption and Attribute-Based Encryption. SSE offers protection against both external and internal threats. It allows for efficient search capabilities while maintaining the confidentiality of the data. In an SSE technique, all data is usually encrypted using a single key. The entire encrypted database would need to be downloaded and re-encrypted with a new key if a user was to be revoked. Conversely, though, ABE offers a more granular approach to access control by encrypting data based on attributes and policies. This means that different users or groups can be granted different levels of access to the data based on their attributes.</p>

## Execution Guide
Step 1: Run the Code Through Eclipse<br/>
Step 2: Copy the URL and paste on the browser, soon the Interface will Appear.<br/>
Step 3: Register Yourself with unique Mail ID,Password, Name, Place and Phone Number.<br/>
Step 4: After Registering, Login with Mail ID and Password.<br/>
Step 5: Upload the files with a Keyword which is named as Index Number and enable Sharing.<br/>
Step 6: The other can Login with his/her mail id and Password and he who want the file can search the file using the Index Number of the Files that First User has uploaded.<br/>
Step 7: After getting the file, Click on the request nutton and the Request will be sent.<br/>
Step 8: The First User will Accept the Request.<br/>
Step 9: Thereby, The Other User Can Download the File of its Original Form.<br/>
