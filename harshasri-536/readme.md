<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>1.Cloud computing has become a significant advancement in IT, but data security remains a major challenge in the cloud environment.</p>
<p>2.To address this issue, a security improvement system for cloud data is proposed, combining hybrid cryptography and steganography.</p>
<p>3.The  system utilizes AES symmetric and RSA asymmetric encryption algorithms for data encryption.</p>
<p>4.Encrypted data is hidden within images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography algorithm.</p>
<p>5.To enhance data capacity, the Lempel Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression algorithm is applied before data embedding.</p>
<p>6.Hash functions, specifically SHA-256, are used for data validation to ensure data integrity without the involvement of third parties.</p>
<p>7.Storing data in multimedia formats, such as images, audio, and video, further enhances security.</p>
<p>8.The system is a promising approach to securing cloud data and holds potential for real-world implementation.</p>
<p>9.Security enhancement system shows significant promise in safeguarding cloud data and preventing unauthorized access.</p>
