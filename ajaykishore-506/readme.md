<h1> ABSTRACT</h1>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
  Cloud Computing has revolutionized the way data is stored and accessed, offering unparalleled convenience and scalability. However, as organizations increasingly rely on cloud services, concerns about data security and privacy in untrusted cloud environments have become paramount.
So, this project approach is to address these concerns, focusing on access control for symmetrically encrypted data stored in untrusted clouds by combining symmetric encryption techniques with fine-grained access control policies, ensuring data remains confidential even when stored in untrusted cloud environments. The project present a comprehensive framework that allows data owners to define access polices, specifying who can access what pars of encrypted data, and under what conditions.

<h1> Introduction </h1>
In cloud computing, people can quickly and easily do important things with their data, like saving, finding, and moving it. But, there's a challenge making sure the data stays safe. This is because the data is stored with another company, and the biggest risks happen when data is not well protected.

This paper suggests a new method to keep cloud-stored data safe. It does this by using both cryptography and steganography together. First, it turns the secret data into a secret code using two special ways: AES256 and RSA. Then, it makes the code smaller and hides it using a special algorithm called LSB.

Making a secret code out of your secret communication is what cryptography does. It serves as a method of information protection. For creating the secret code, a unique algorithm is used called encryption. It uses a certain key to muddle the message and render it unintelligible.

Imagine having a unique key that can lock and open a box. This is symmetric encryption. The secret message is locked (encrypted) and unlocked (decrypted) using the same key in symmetric encryption. It resembles using a single key for the lock and keyhole. Asymmetric encryption: Two keys are used in this case. One key functions as a lock, while the other as a unique key that unlocks the lock. Together, these keys ensure that only the appropriate individuals may read.
