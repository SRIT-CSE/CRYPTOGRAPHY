  <li>One of the important significance of technology is cloud computing. But maintaining the security is another big problem in cloud environment.
  data may be lost due to interuption or inception in cloud environment</li>
  <li>So,to overcome that drawbacks from the security issues. we proposed a system for improving of data in the cloud using hybrid cryptography and using the steganography as one of the stages of secure providing. </li>
  <li>In data encryption phase,we implemented AES symmetric algorithm and RSA asymmetric algorithm as a hybrid Cryptography Algorithms.</li>
  <li>After the completion of encryption phase,we store the encrypted data in a image using LSB algorithm.</li>
  <li>Also we compress the data before hiding the data in an image using LZW algorithm so that the more plain text can be inserted into the image. </li>
  <li> In the data Validation phase,we use SHA algorithm to find out the hashvalue.</li>
  <li>By using of information concealment and double encryption system we can improve the security of data that been sent to the cloud.</li>
  <li>In this paper,the values of SSIM and PSNR are calculated along with graph to evaluate the image frequency performance before and after applying the compression algroithm. The data showed that PSNR values of stego-image are better for data that has been compressed.</li>
