    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Cloud data is more secure using hybrid cryptograghy, it means we are using a combination of methods to protect information stored in cloud computing systems.</li>
          <li>And nowadays with the rapid growth of cloud services, there is a big concern about keeping data safe when it is stored int he cloud.</li>
          <li>Both businesses and regular people think carefully about the safety of their data before they decide to store it online.</li>
          <li>In the cloud, your data can be stored in a way thats looks like a secret code, making it harder for unauthorized people to read.</li>
          <li>When we encrypt something, we use a special key to turn files into this secret code, and we also set rules about who can access it.</li>
          <li>Every user has their own secret key that matches their specific charactristics or attributes.</li>
          <li>To decode the secret code and see the data, you need to have the right attributes that match the rules we set when we encryted it.</li>
