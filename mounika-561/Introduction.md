        Firstly, The cloud computing is divided into three layers, Those are infrastructure as a service(IaaS), software as a service(SaaS), Platfrom as a service(PaaS)
      </li>
      <li>
        IaaS provides users with virtual machines and storage so they can build their infrasructure on them.
      </li>
      <li>
        SaaS provides services and applications for users in order to use them in building, developing, testing and managing their applications
      </li>
      <li>
        PaaS provides services and applcations to users anytime, anywhere through a web browser.
      </li>
      <li>
        Despite being having many facts,The problem that arises here is data is stored at a third party and threats are greates when users store their data in a clear form.
      </li>
      <li>
        that is why, the techniques are used to protect sensitive data, those are cryptography and steganography.
      </li>
      <li>
        The process of converting data into unreadable code is known as Crptography, We can encrypt the data using key and some encryption algorithms require one key to encrypt and decrypt called symmetric encryption and the algorithms which need two keys to encrypt and decrypt the data known as Asymmetric and they need a public key and a private key for decryption.
      </li>
      <li>
        The process ofprotecting the data through hiding confidential data in cover object such as image, voice and text. The strength of steganography depends on the ability to integrate the indistinctness data into cover object     </li>
