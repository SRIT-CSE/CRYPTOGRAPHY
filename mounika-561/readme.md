      <li>The security improvement of cloud data using hybrid Cryptography and steganography is based on cloud computing. </li>
        <li>It is the idea of developing the security for the cloud storage using encyption, concealment and hashing functions. The algorithms used are AES,RSA,LZW,LSB and SHA.</li>
        <li>In the encryption phase, we use AES and RSA algorithm.</li>
        <li>The encypted data will be hidden using LSB algorithm as an Image. </li>
        <li>The data security will be provided using concealment Technology. The PSNR and SSIM are used for image masking and it shows the values of stego-image of PSNR for data compression. </li>
        <li>For validation purpose, the SHA key is used.</li>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<body>
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Firstly, The cloud computing is divided into three layers, Those are infrastructure as a service(IaaS), software as a service(SaaS), Platfrom as a service(PaaS)
      </li>
      <li>
        IaaS provides users with virtual machines and storage so they can build their infrasructure on them.
      </li>
      <li>
        SaaS provides services and applications for users in order to use them in building, developing, testing and managing their applications
      </li>
      <li>
        PaaS provides services and applcations to users anytime, anywhere through a web browser.
      </li>
      <li>
        Despite being having many facts,The problem that arises here is data is stored at a third party and threats arises when users store their data in a clear form.
      </li>
      <li>
        that is why, the techniques are used to protect sensitive data, those are cryptography and steganography.
      </li>
      <li>
        The process of converting data into unreadable code is known as Crptography, We can encrypt the data using key and some encryption algorithms require one key to encrypt and decrypt called symmetric encryption and the algorithms which need two keys to encrypt and decrypt the data known as Asymmetric and they need a public key and a private key for decryption.
      </li>
      <li>
        The process ofprotecting the data through hiding confidential data in cover object such as image, voice and text. The strength of steganography depends on the ability to integrate the indistinctness data into cover object     </li>
      <li>
        The proposed system is to protect the data stored in the cloud by combining the techniques of cryptography and steganography. The encyption is done by using the symmetric encyption algorithm AES256 and the asymmetric encryption algorithm RSA. For the compression of data, we need LSB algorithm. Hash functions are used for the third party confirmation. Coming to the steganography part, we used PSNR and SSIM to check the quality the stego-image.
